in bloom
=====================

in bloom, serves as dynamic signage that enables a flower shop owner to easily update the shop’s hours from an iPhone, iPad, or browser. The interface also allows customers who visit the shop during closed hours to leave contact information. The florist can then call or email the customer within the application if she is using a device that has email and telephone capabilities.

Ideally, one iPad interface would serve as the storefront's signage/kiosk while the owner updates store hours using an iPhone when she’s on the go or at home. For errands and deliveries, the florist can update her signage to indicate out for delivery. She can then either update her status when she returns to the store or not. in bloom will update the signage after 15 minutes.

in bloom is built with Ionic, giving the store owner the flexibility of accessing her dynamic signage from an iPad, iPhone, Android, or in the browser.
